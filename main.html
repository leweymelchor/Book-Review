                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort.
                    Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning
                    styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It
                    Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries
                    in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques
                    for becoming more productive learners.</p>

                    entertain programmers while enhancing their Python skills. It picks up where the
                    complete beginner books leave off, expanding on existing concepts and introducing new
                    tools that you'll use every day. And to keep things interesting, each project includes
                    a zany twist featuring historical incidents, pop culture references, and literary allusions.</p>
