                <div class="book-rating">3.5 Stars</div>
                <div class="book-authors">By Joshua Weissman</div>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A Weissman once said…

                    "...can we please stop with the barrage of 2.3 second meals that only need 1 ingredient? I get it…we’re busy.
                    But let’s refocus on the fact that beautifully crafted burgers don't grow on trees."

                    Ironically this sounds a lot like he's trying to convince you to cook, but he's really not. Is this selling
                    the cookbook? The point is that the food in this book is an invitation that speaks for itself. Great cooking
                    does, and should, take time. Now is the time to double down and get your head in the cooking game. Or you know,
                    don't. Maybe get someone else to cook this stuff for you...that works too.</p>

                <div class="book-authors">By Michael Crichton</div>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>A military space probe, sent to collect extraterrestrial organisms from the upper atmosphere, is knocked out of
                    orbit and falls to Earth. Twelve miles from the crash site, an inexplicable and deadly phenomenon terrorizes the
                    residents of a sleepy desert town in Arizona, leaving only two survivors: an elderly addict and a newborn infant.</p>

                <div class="book-rating">4.5 Stars</div>
                <div class="book-authors">By Lee Vaughn</div>
                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>Impractical Python Projects is a collection of fun and educational projects designed to
                    entertain programmers while enhancing their Python skills. It picks up where the
                    complete beginner books leave off, expanding on existing concepts and introducing new
                    tools that you'll use every day. And to keep things interesting, each project includes
                    a zany twist featuring historical incidents, pop culture references, and literary allusions.</p>

                <h3>Summary</h3>
                <p>To most of us, learning something "the hard way" implies wasted time and effort.
                    Good teaching, we believe, should be creatively tailored to the different learning
                    styles of students and should use strategies that make learning easier. Make It
                    Stick turns fashionable ideas like these on their head. Drawing on recent discoveries
                    in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques
                    for becoming more productive learners.</p>
