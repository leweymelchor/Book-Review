                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>“If I could, I would assign all professors charged with teaching undergraduates
                    one book: Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning… It lays out what
                    we know about the science of learning in clear, accessible prose. Every
                    educator―and parent, and student, and professional―ought to have it on their
                    own personal syllabus.”―Annie Murphy Paul, The Brilliant blog</p>
                <h2>My review</h2>
                <div>
                    <p>“Presents a compelling case for why we are attracted to the wrong
                        strategies for learning and teaching―and what we can do to remedy
                        our approaches… In clear language, Make It Stick explains the science
                        underlying how people learn. But the authors don’t simply recite the
                        research; they show readers how it is applied in real-life learning
                        scenarios, with engaging stories of real people in academic, professional,
                        and sports environments… The learning strategies proposed in this book can
                        be implemented immediately, at no cost, and to great effect… Make It Stick
                        will help you become a much more productive learner.”
                    </p>
                    <p>“Aimed primarily at students, parents, and teachers, Make It Stick also
                        offers practical advice for learners of all ages, at all stages of life…
                        With its credible challenge to conventional wisdom, Make It Stick does point
                        the way forward, with a very real prospect of tangible and enduring benefits.”
